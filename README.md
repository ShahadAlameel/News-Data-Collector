    "text": "England\u2019s Roses overturned an eight-goal deficit to claim their first  Netball  World Cup win, 56-55, over Australia and advance to the semi-finals as pool winners. Down by one goal heading into the final quarter, England, led by shooters Helen Housby (22 from 22) and Eleanor Cardwell (34 from 35), came marching back to beat the  Diamonds . Savvy substitutions, defensive pressure and costly turnovers ultimately led the world No 1 side to an unexpected defeat. England\u2019s coach, Jess Thirlby, credited a complete squad performance with the historic win. \u201cWe know that we have depth in this 12,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken a lot around that kind of tactical change-up that we can apply, particularly in the defensive end, we\u2019ve just got so many combinations. \u201cWe know how good we are. And from a tactic point of view, we\u2019re on par with the top teams. The most reassuring thing that we\u2019ll take away from today, and it was much needed, is to be able to come back from eight down to see a game out in the open and closing quarter.\u201d While both teams had already qualified for the semi-finals, the Roses will now have the easier route as they line up against New Zealand who lost to Jamaica 59-48 after drawing with the hosts, South Africa, the night before. Australia will play Jamaica, who they narrowly beat to win the Commonwealth title last year. Though calling the loss to England disappointing the  Diamonds  captain, Liz Watson, insisted they were prepared for everyone. \u201cI said to the group after the game that our vision is still there and to be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn from this game, obviously, because it\u2019s a disappointing loss. But like Stacey [Marinkovich, Australia\u2019s coach] said, there were lots of positives, especially in that second quarter.\u201d Having gone mostly untested in the tournament both sides were expected to show a little rust. The Diamonds displayed that in the opening frame as England imposed themselves. The defending end \u2013 Geva Mentor, Layla Guscoth and Laura Malcolm \u2013 blunted Australia\u2019s offence and in attack Cardwell was the perfect release point as the Roses rode out sustained pressure from their opposite. A trickle of errors coupled with two blinding intercepts handed England the lead, which at one point, extended to five. The scoreline forced Australia\u2019s hand with Sarah Klau brought in at goalkeeper; a nod to the efforts of Cardwell. Sign up to  The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action after newsletter promotion As was always the plan, Thirlby made the first of her changes, introducing  Funmi Fadoju  at the 10-minute mark. Her impact was instant and at the end of the quarter the Roses were in front 15-13. Sometimes, even Diamonds need a little polish. With Klau commanding from the back, Australia started to force mistakes. From 17-15 down, they surged to a 21-19 lead, pushing Thirlby to change. But the Diamonds did not fold and by the end of the quarter they were 32-26 ahead. If Australia were expecting a walkover, England were not prepared to give it. Thirlby shuffled the deck to start the second half and the new unit showed purpose. Chelsea Pitman, in at wing attack, unlocked Cardwell and Housby who put up a string of six unanswered goals to chomp into the lead. The start of the fourth was a microcosm of the game. Australia started in possession before England turned it back. Then with Australia about to score England snatched it back. But the English fans here never stopped believing and on the stroke of the 49th minute their side recaptured the lead. The Diamonds, throwing bibs around to find the personnel to halt the Roses, did draw things back to level with just under two minutes remaining. But as Australia went to equalise, a soft pass was all the invitation Fran Williams needed to claim the turnover. As the final 10 seconds counted down England maintained possession to take the win.",

    "text": "A Romanian court has ordered the release from house arrest of the self-proclaimed misogynist  Andrew Tate , who is awaiting trial on charges of human trafficking. The court has placed Tate,  a social media personality known for expressing misogynistic views , under judicial control, a less restrictive measure. The Bucharest court of appeals said in a written ruling that it \u201creplaces the house arrest measure with that of judicial control for a period of 60 days from August 4 until October 2\u201d. Tate and his brother Tristan, both of whom have dual US and British citizenship, were  charged in June  along with two Romanian female suspects of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. The suspects have denied the allegations. Under the new measure, the four suspects can leave the house, but not Bucharest and the surrounding Ilfov county. They must check in regularly with the police. They are also banned from trying to approach the alleged victims. Romania\u2019s anti-organised crime agency alleged the four defendants had formed a criminal group in 2021 \u201cin order to commit the crime of human trafficking\u201d in  Romania  as well as the US and Britain. The agency alleged seven female victims had been misled and transported to  Romania , where they were sexually exploited and subjected to physical violence by the gang. One defendant is accused of raping a woman twice in March 2022, according to the statement. Tate and his brother  launched a lawsuit  against a Florida woman in July, saying she falsely accused them of imprisoning her in Romania, leading to their arrest there on human trafficking charges. The brothers are seeking at least $5m (\u00a33.9m) in the lawsuit, which was filed in Palm Beach county against the woman, her parents, another woman who lived at the Tates\u2019 Bucharest estate and a male friend of the woman. In the UK  four British women have joined a civil claim for damages  against Tate, alleging they were victims of sexual and physical assault by him. The women have said they intend to commence proceedings against the social media personality.",

    "text": "TikTok is to be fined potentially millions of pounds for breaching children\u2019s privacy after a ruling by EU data protection regulator. The European Data Protection Board said it had reached a binding decision on the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform over its processing of children\u2019s data. The regulator had \u201cadopted a dispute resolution decision\u201d after Tiktok submitted legal objections to an earlier ruling in Ireland, home of the company\u2019s European headquarters. The fine is expected to be issued within the next four weeks. The EU decision follows an investigation, opened in 2021, by the data protection commissioner in Ireland into TikTok\u2019s level of compliance with the EU\u2019s general data protection regulation and how it handles the data of children aged 13 to 17 . On Friday, TikTok announced a number of new features for European users aimed at improving compliance with new  European Union  regulations on content, which come into force on 25 August. Under the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA), TikTok, Google, Facebook and other large online platforms will be required to police illegal content on their platforms, prohibit certain advertising practices, and share data with authorities. After TikTok agreed to a voluntary \u201cstress test\u201d in its Dublin HQ last month, the EU technology commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the company needed to do more work to be fully compliant. Breton told CNN: \u201cTikTok is dedicating significant resources to compliance. Now it\u2019s time to accelerate to be fully compliant.\u201d On Friday, the company said new measures it had taken to comply with the DSA included: making it easier for EU users to report illegal content; allowing them to turn off personalised recommendations for videos; and removing targeted advertising for users aged 13 to 17. It said: \u201cWe will continue to not only meet our regulatory obligations, but also strive to set new standards through innovative solutions.\u201d Sign up to  TechScape Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Earlier this year,  TikTok was fined \u00a312.7m  by the UK data watchdog for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children aged under 13 who were using the service without parental consent. The British information commissioner said the company had done \u201cvery little, if anything\u201d to check who was using the platform and remove underage users, despite having received internal warnings that it was flouting its own terms and conditions. A 2022 survey by the UK regulator Ofcom showed that more than 60% of eight- to 17-year-olds who use social media had a TikTok account in their own name.",

    "text": "A Gold Coast businessman with ties to former Liberal MP Stuart Robert remains listed as a director in at least 10 Australian companies despite  \u201csevering ties\u201d and living abroad . John Margerison had been called as a key witness for a parliamentary hearing in July into  contracts awarded by Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency . But public accounts and audits committee chair Julian Hill said the hearing could no longer go ahead after Margerison\u2019s lawyer informed him the businessman had  severed all ties with Australia and was now living overseas , outside the jurisdiction of parliament. Guardian Australia can reveal, however, Margerison remains a director of at least 10 Australian companies, including four linked to the DJ Group associated with NDIS providers. The committee summoned Margerison, who is a Liberal party fundraiser and who Robert once described as a \u201cvery good friend\u201d, to answer questions over  his involvement in a scheme that allegedly proposed  to deliver the former Fadden MP financial kickbacks from government contracts that he helped win for its clients. Consulting firm Synergy 360 is at the centre of the committee\u2019s inquiry after claims it discussed a plan to transfer a 20% stake to United Marketing \u2013 a company owned by Margerison. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A co-founder of Synergy 360, Anthony Daly,  told the committee in June  the 20% stake would have facilitated \u201cthe flow of funds through United Marketing and onward to Stuart Robert\u201d. Robert rejected the allegation \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, adding there was \u201czero evidence\u201d for it. Guardian Australia asked Margerison\u2019s lawyer on Friday to clarify what \u201csevering ties\u201d meant and to explain his role in the companies for which he remains listed as a director. No response has been received. The Gold Coast investor was involved as a major shareholder and director of United Disability Care \u2013 a large not-for-profit disability services provider. The NDIS-approved provider\u2019s most recent financial report lists three companies \u2013 Corporate Link Services Pty Ltd, DS IP & Technology Pty Ltd and DJ Property Pty Ltd \u2013 as being related parties. The latter two companies still list Margersion as a director, according to records from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Another eight companies still list Margerison as a director, including D J Capital Holdings Pty Ltd, D J Capital Solutions Pty Ltd, DJ Capital Pty Ltd, Frontier Mortgages Pty Ltd, MC Fraui Pty Ltd, United Marketing Pty Ltd, Australian Property Reserve Pty Ltd and JM National Property Pty Ltd. All the companies are linked to the same accountant, Sean Beasley, and a Gold Coast address in Robina. Margerison\u2019s business associate, Mike Ribot, was appointed a director for Corporate Link Services Pty Ltd in December 2022. Ribot said he remained the sole director for the company, which lists Margerison\u2019s United Marketing as the parent company. Sign up to  Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter after newsletter promotion Ribot also holds five shares in United Disability Care (UDC) but says he receives no financial benefit and held the shares as a \u201csafe set of hands\u201d through the \u201cturbulent period\u201d. \u201cThere is no benefit, financial or otherwise, to be derived from ownership of these shares. I have been involved as a business coach and consultant to UDC since 2018 and have a good understanding of the company and the disability sector,\u201d he said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cMy wife Katherine and I were seen as a \u2018safe set of hands\u2019 to hold the shares in UDC during this turbulent period. \u201cWe are not on the UDC board, or involved in UDC board decision making, or strategy.\u201d Ribot said he had no thoughts to add on Margerison having left the country. \u201cJohn is, has been... and will continue to be a friend and business associate,\u201d he said. Hill previously said the committee would consider the letter from Margerison\u2019s lawyers at its next meeting. \u201cThat Mr Margerison\u2019s lawyer now claims he has left and severed all ties with Australia is a somewhat surprising turn of events indeed,\u201d he said last month. \u201cThe committee will make findings based on the evidence before it. It remains within the JCPAA\u2019s power to recommend referrals to other investigative bodies with additional resources and powers.\u201d",
